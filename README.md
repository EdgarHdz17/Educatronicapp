# Educatronicapp
Educatronicapp is a multiplatform mobile application (Android and IOS) developed at Expo React Native, this application is called “Educatronicapp”, its objective is to enable its users to learn to program the basic concepts of programming using a defined natural language. In addition, this mobile application is part of the “Educatronica” project led by Dr. Enrique Ruiz Velasco, Dr. Josefina Bárcenas and the M. in C. Víctor Hugo García Ortega, a project in which different educational aspects are mixed such as programming, electronics and pedagogical robotics, so the “Educatronicapp” application has communication using DTMF sounds to interact with an electronic interface and a pedagogical robot (elevator).
“Educatronicapp” has the premise of being oriented towards inclusivity to be used by users with some type of motor disability, which is why artificial intelligence technologies such as voice recognition were included using a RESTAPI called Speech to Text belonging to Open AI.
